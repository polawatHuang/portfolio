    content: `<h2>Imposter Syndrome</h2><p>Leaders are most effective in leading through complexity when they become conscious that their thinking has linked a "self-oriented meaning" to a difficulty, preventing them from seeing all of the possibilities. The Outward Mindset is a lens that allows a leader to recognize when they become overly focused on self, including anxieties about their own personal worth and how others view them. This self-focus process causes a shift in behaviour and decision making, reducing their competencies in these areas and potentially harming the team they manage and the organisation they serve. It can also cause extreme stress for people, with the risk of their burning out or breaking down.</p><p>Imposter syndrome is defined as an internal experience in which you believe you are less capable than others think you to be. As a mindset coach, I\'ve worked with over 100 senior leaders who mention imposter syndrome; it almost appears to be a rite of passage.</p><p>Humans' underlying psychological anxiety of not being good enough has been thoroughly documented. When I coach, this dynamic needs to be confirmed, considered, and handled. Eventually, maintaining impostor syndrome becomes a decision.</p><p>When a crisis necessitates a leader to answer quickly in the face of complexity, the instinct to construct a binary polarity response—be consultative and seek collaboration or decide and dictate—may arise immediately. The question a leader should ask themselves is how often that automatic response about themselves occurs. Is the mindset to be valuable? 'I should know the answer.' 'I'm the leader; I must demonstrate leadership'.</p><p>What happens if you add the Imposter worries of 'If people could see how unsure I feel, what would they think?' and 'I have doubts, but I know what to do, but that fear needs to be repressed and hidden'? How often does a leader instinctively react with a functional reaction that may be more about showing one's own worth than about what the problem or opportunity requires?</p><p>What if the most Outward Mindset response in a given situation is to stand in the so-called Imposter space and say, ‘I don’t know what to do?’ ‘Can anyone see things I cannot?’ ‘If none of us can see an instant solution to this complexity, can anyone see the first step to micro-test a hypothesis and we can learn?’</p><p>What if a leader recognises Imposter syndrome as a potential pre-written excuse to not stand in uncertainty? What if a leader makes a choice without the fear of ‘how will I look’? Or ‘what will people think?’ to just test a hypothesis or intuition.</p><p>Being Outward is shown to be the essential element of a successful human response to uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity and velocity. Does your organisation need to create a more psychological safe place and encourage a culture where Imposter syndrome finds it hard to flourish?</p><div class='mt-4 p-6 text-center border-[1px] border-gray-300'><h3>Stay connected with news and updates!</h3><p>Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from our team.<br />Don't worry, your information will not be shared.</p><p>We hate SPAM.

    content: `<p>Today I'm working at my kitchen table, with client responsibilities, emails to respond, and this blog to write. In addition, today I am responsible for four 10- to 13-year-old boys playing with water balloons in the garden close outside (two of them are my). I'm writing with one eye and ear on them and one on the text. I can feel my mind turning inside throughout the juggle and challenge. When I feel the pressure rising, I use one of the Outward Mindset coaching techniques: I shift my inward thought to 'I have to'.</p><p>Work can feel like a chore when you 'have to' do it. The inbox pinging causes tension, and the client task I'm doing is 'hard'! I have to (see it!) dig deep for every syllable, as if it is heavy on my shoulders. If the customer calls, I will respond professionally, but I feel as if they are a 'have to' pressure; a hurdle to me. If one of my coworkers mistakenly asks for something, they may receive an angry look and a martyr-like sigh as my exhausted 'have to' transforms into perceiving them as an impediment to my success.</p><p>When I feel obligated to monitor the boys, they are loud, disrespectful, and have no concept how much work I have to accomplish. I have to compromise my professional experience to meet their needs, which is quite difficult! In this version of reality, the boys are hurdles to me and my needs.</p><p>I 'get to' see my boys laugh a lot! Yes, they are loud, but if I make a clear request, they will calm down. I get to celebrate their friendships and outside activities, something I wish kids would do when they are stuck behind screens.</p><p>I remember that I get to do what I enjoy while also being a parent, which is an important aspect of my life. I get to have my inbox filled with new opportunities. After Covid19, or at least during this break, I have the opportunity to attempt different ways of working. I get to push myself in completely new ways yet my customers, partner, colleagues, and children remain individuals to me.</p><p>Today, try using 'get to' instead of 'have to' and observe how your perspective on others around you changes.</p><div class='mt-4 p-6 text-center border-[1px] border-gray-300'><h3>Stay connected with news and updates!</h3><p>Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from our team.<br />Don't worry, your information will not be shared.</p><p>We hate SPAM.
